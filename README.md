[ScoreSheet](https://score.pieterp.be/) is a competition management program for the Belgian table tennis competition. This program is the official replacement for the popular but deprecated competition manager 'Wedstrijdblad'.

ScoreSheet is not only free, but the source code (C #, WPF) is also freely available here on GitHub. Do you want to help? [Contact us](mailto:score@pieterp.be)!

This repository is meant for developers interested in the ScoreSheet source code. If you simply want to install ScoreSheet on your computer, please download it from [the official website](https://score.pieterp.be/).
